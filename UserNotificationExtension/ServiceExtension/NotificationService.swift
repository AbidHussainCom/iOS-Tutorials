/**
 Service extension lets you customize the content of a remote notification before it is delivered to the user:
 
 Some potential uses of Service Extensions include:
 
 Providing end-to-end encryption of the Remote Notification content.
 Adding attachments to Remote Notifications to enrich them.
 
 Once you have configured your app with a notification service extension, the following process will take place for each notification:
 1 App receives notification.
 2 System creates an instance of your extension class and launches it in the background.
 3 Your extension performs content edits and/or downloads some content.
 4 If your extension takes too long to perform its work, it will be notified and immediately terminated.
 5 Notification is displayed to the user.
