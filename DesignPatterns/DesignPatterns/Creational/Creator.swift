// In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms,
// trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in
// design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling
// this object creation.

class Creator {
    let singleton: Singleton
    let car: Vehicle?
    
    init() {
        // üíç Singleton
        // The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created. All further references
        // to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance. There are very few applications,
        // do not overuse this pattern!
        self.singleton = Singleton.shared
        
        // üè≠ Factory Method
        // The factory pattern is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so
        // that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.
        self.car = VehicleFactory.vehicle(.car)
    }
