/**
 
 Haptic feedbacks are small vibrations that convey message to user.
 
 //At this time, only the new Taptic Engine found in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus support these APIs. Other devices
   silently ignore the haptic requests.
 
 -  The first rule of haptic feedback from the iOS Human Interface Guidelines: do not overuse it! You shouldn't send
    useless feedback to your users. If you do, they might decide to turn off this feature for their whole device.
 -  Because it can be disabled, don't use haptic feedback as your only method of feedback with your user.
 -  It may not be available on some devices, and the requests will silently be ignored on older devices that don't
    support it.
 
 How to Choose the Right Feedback
    
 -  UIImpactFeedbackGenerator provides a physical metaphor that complements the visual experience. For example, the user
    might feel a thud when a view slides into place or two objects collide. It has three variations: success, warning, 
    and failure.
 -  UINotificationFeedbackGenerator indicates that a task or action, such as depositing a check or unlocking a vehicle,
    has completed, failed, or produced a warning. It has three variations: light, medium, and heavy.
 -  UISelectionFeedbackGenerator indicates that the selection is actively changing. For example, the user feels light 
    taps while scrolling a picker wheel. This feedback is intended for communicating movement through a series of 
    discrete values, not making or confirming a selection.
